    "## Getting Started\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, you will employ several supervised algorithms of your choice to accurately model individuals' income using data collected from the 1994 U.S. Census. You will then choose the best candidate algorithm from preliminary results and further optimize this algorithm to best model the data. Your goal with this implementation is to construct a model that accurately predicts whether an individual makes more than $50,000. This sort of task can arise in a non-profit setting, where organizations survive on donations.  Understanding an individual's income can help a non-profit better understand how large of a donation to request, or whether or not they should reach out to begin with.  While it can be difficult to determine an individual's general income bracket directly from public sources, we can (as we will see) infer this value from other publically available features. \n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset for this project originates from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Census+Income). The datset was donated by Ron Kohavi and Barry Becker, after being published in the article _\"Scaling Up the Accuracy of Naive-Bayes Classifiers: A Decision-Tree Hybrid\"_. You can find the article by Ron Kohavi [online](https://www.aaai.org/Papers/KDD/1996/KDD96-033.pdf). The data we investigate here consists of small changes to the original dataset, such as removing the `'fnlwgt'` feature and records with missing or ill-formatted entries."

    "For highly-skewed feature distributions such as `'capital-gain'` and `'capital-loss'`, it is common practice to apply a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_transformation_(statistics)\">logarithmic transformation</a> on the data so that the very large and very small values do not negatively affect the performance of a learning algorithm. Using a logarithmic transformation significantly reduces the range of values caused by outliers. Care must be taken when applying this transformation however: The logarithm of `0` is undefined, so we must translate the values by a small amount above `0` to apply the the logarithm successfully.\n",

    "In addition to performing transformations on features that are highly skewed, it is often good practice to perform some type of scaling on numerical features. Applying a scaling to the data does not change the shape of each feature's distribution (such as `'capital-gain'` or `'capital-loss'` above); however, normalization ensures that each feature is treated equally when applying supervised learners. Note that once scaling is applied, observing the data in its raw form will no longer have the same original meaning, as exampled below.\n",

    "Run the code cell below to normalize each numerical feature. We will use [`sklearn.preprocessing.MinMaxScaler`](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.preprocessing.MinMaxScaler.html) for this."

    "From the table in **Exploring the Data** above, we can see there are several features for each record that are non-numeric. Typically, learning algorithms expect input to be numeric, which requires that non-numeric features (called *categorical variables*) be converted. One popular way to convert categorical variables is by using the **one-hot encoding** scheme. One-hot encoding creates a _\"dummy\"_ variable for each possible category of each non-numeric feature. For example, assume `someFeature` has three possible entries: `A`, `B`, or `C`. We then encode this feature into `someFeature_A`, `someFeature_B` and `someFeature_C`.\n",

    "Additionally, as with the non-numeric features, we need to convert the non-numeric target label, `'income'` to numerical values for the learning algorithm to work. Since there are only two possible categories for this label (\"<=50K\" and \">50K\"), we can avoid using one-hot encoding and simply encode these two categories as `0` and `1`, respectively. In code cell below, you will need to implement the following:\n",
    " - Use [`pandas.get_dummies()`](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.get_dummies.html?highlight=get_dummies#pandas.get_dummies) to perform one-hot encoding on the `'features_log_minmax_transform'` data.\n",

    "### Metrics and the Naive Predictor\n",
    "*CharityML*, equipped with their research, knows individuals that make more than \\$50,000 are most likely to donate to their charity. Because of this, *CharityML* is particularly interested in predicting who makes more than \\$50,000 accurately. It would seem that using **accuracy** as a metric for evaluating a particular model's performace would be appropriate. Additionally, identifying someone that *does not* make more than \\$50,000 as someone who does would be detrimental to *CharityML*, since they are looking to find individuals willing to donate. Therefore, a model's ability to precisely predict those that make more than \\$50,000 is *more important* than the model's ability to **recall** those individuals. We can use **F-beta score** as a metric that considers both precision and recall:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ F_{\\beta} = (1 + \\beta^2) \\cdot \\frac{precision \\cdot recall}{\\left( \\beta^2 \\cdot precision \\right) + recall} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "In particular, when $\\beta = 0.5$, more emphasis is placed on precision. This is called the **F$_{0.5}$ score** (or F-score for simplicity).\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking at the distribution of classes (those who make at most \\$50,000, and those who make more), it's clear most individuals do not make more than \\$50,000. This can greatly affect **accuracy**, since we could simply say *\"this person does not make more than \\$50,000\"* and generally be right, without ever looking at the data! Making such a statement would be called **naive**, since we have not considered any information to substantiate the claim. It is always important to consider the *naive prediction* for your data, to help establish a benchmark for whether a model is performing well. That been said, using that prediction would be pointless: If we predicted all people made less than \\$50,000, *CharityML* would identify no one as donors. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Note: Recap of accuracy, precision, recall\n",
    "\n",
    "** Accuracy ** measures how often the classifier makes the correct prediction. It’s the ratio of the number of correct predictions to the total number of predictions (the number of test data points).\n",
    "\n",
    "** Precision ** tells us what proportion of messages we classified as spam, actually were spam.\n",
    "It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all positives(all words classified as spam, irrespective of whether that was the correct classificatio), in other words it is the ratio of\n",
    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Positives)]`\n",
    "\n",
    "** Recall(sensitivity)** tells us what proportion of messages that actually were spam were classified by us as spam.\n",
    "It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all the words that were actually spam, in other words it is the ratio of\n",
    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Negatives)]`\n",
    "\n",
    "For classification problems that are skewed in their classification distributions like in our case, for example if we had a 100 text messages and only 2 were spam and the rest 98 weren't, accuracy by itself is not a very good metric. We could classify 90 messages as not spam(including the 2 that were spam but we classify them as not spam, hence they would be false negatives) and 10 as spam(all 10 false positives) and still get a reasonably good accuracy score. For such cases, precision and recall come in very handy. These two metrics can be combined to get the F1 score, which is weighted average(harmonic mean) of the precision and recall scores. This score can range from 0 to 1, with 1 being the best possible F1 score(we take the harmonic mean as we are dealing with ratios)."

    "Ensemble Methods (Bagging, AdaBoost, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting)\n",
    "- Describe one real-world application in industry where the model can be applied? \n",
    "Netflix utilizes ensemble methods for the systems used to provide recommendations to it's users. Some of the initial code sets to develop Netflix recommnedation systems were based on the results of competition submissions, where some of the highest performing models were ensemble methods.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- What are the strengths of the model; when does it perform well?\n",
    "It combines/average the results of multiple models to increase accuracy of the model. This approach also provides stability to your model by combining the input of multiple models and provides a more diversified answer rather than relying on the recommendation results of just one model. Ensemble methods also don't tend to need extensive pre-processing required to perform (i.e. cleansing, etc.)\n",
    "  \n",
    "- What are the weaknesses of the model; when does it perform poorly?\n",
    "When working in a probabilistic setting, ensemble methods may not work either and can deliver poor probability estimates when compared purely to classification problems. \n",
    "\n",
    "- What makes this model a good candidate for the problem, given what you know about the data?\n",
    " I think ensemble methods will be good fit as it works great on weak learners and builds sequential trees increasing the accuracy over time for the model. Also, this data includes a good mixture of categorical and numerical features that don't require an significant amount of pre-processing.\n",
    "  \n",
    "Decision Tree\n",
    "- Describe one real-world application in industry where the model can be applied.\n",
    "Decision Tress are integrated into the decision making processes for a lot of customer and call center operations and a significant number of companies. It helps staff making decisions and provide resolutions to customers in a more efficient manner. Some of these metrics include first call resolution and customer satisfaction rate.\n",
    "- What are the strengths of the model; when does it perform well?\n",
    "-Decision trees have high interpretability for the model output\n",
    "-Seamless to code, visualize, manipulate, and explain the outputs\n",

    "-Can a majority of the time have problems with overfitting data\n",

    "SVMs are widely used across many applications, but one very common use is to classify handwritten words/characters. A lot of apps are available for this service, and SVMs in a majority of the cases are the underlying model in the background. \n",
    "- What are the strengths of the model; when does it perform well?\n",
    "SVMs perform well for smaller datasets which don't have a significant number of features. It's hyperparameters including the kernel trick allow you build knowledge about the problem through modifying it's weight. Polynomial and rbf kernels enable the user to effectively tackle classification problems with multi-dimensional implications that require complex boundardies to be produced. The benefit is that you can capture much more complex relationships between your datapoints without having to perform difficult transformations on your own.\n",
    "- What are the weaknesses of the model; when does it perform poorly?\n",
    "SVMs don't perform well for larger datasets as the computational complexity of the model will increase. Depending on the situation, SVMs can tend to overfit the results of your model as well.\n",
    "- What makes this model a good candidate for the problem, given what you know about the data?\n",
    "SVM will perform well for this model since it's relatively small dataset that will not require extensive computational requirements. There can be complex relationship to determine a person's income, which can be represented with minimal feature engineering by the SVM.\n",

    "The Decision Tree classifier performs much better on the training set in terms of the accuracy and F-Score, while the Random Forest classifier generalizes well by demonstrating better accuracy and F-score on the test set, but with less interpretability when compared to the DecisionTree. Based on the results provided by the SVM, it performs poorly when compared to the other two models and takes a significant amount of time to both train and test.\n",

    "**Answer: RandomForest is an ensemble method which can be useful for both classification and regression tasks. It's one of the most widely used models today due to it's simplicity, and the fact that it doesn't require a significant amount of tuning or manuipulation to perform effectively. It works by taking a different combination of variables/features from the dataset and constructing multiple trees with these feature sets to predict an outcome. It then combines the answers from the multiple trees / outputs, and then merges the results for more accurate and stable prediction.\n",
    "\n",
    "It laymans terms, we can think of this model as hundreds of humans each providing a prediction on a target variable such as the temperature outside. The model then takes each person's predicition and pools them together to form one answer. This allows us to incorporate the knowledge of multiple individuals who all learn and observe their environment differently. \n",

For example 0-22 is rather low-income levels as this the range from when a person is born all the way until they finish university of college. There are outliers who start making over 50k at the latter end of 22 because they go into a profitable trade and don't go to university. Then 22-60 is the working years of ones life where you in most cases see a linear increase in one's income until retirement. Therefore, age is a significant factor when predicting income.\n",

    "3) education_level: A person's education level on average tends to be an important feature as a person is not able profitable professions such as becoming a doctor or a lawyer without going to graduate school. Whereas a person who goes to college and receives a trade depending on the country can tend to achieve lower income levels when compared to people with higher education levels. Therefore, in a majority of the cases a higher education level dictates higher income levels. This feature is highly correlated with occupation.    \n",

    "How does a model perform if we only use a subset of all the available features in the data? With less features required to train, the expectation is that training and prediction time is much lower — at the cost of performance metrics. From the visualization above, we see that the top five most important features contribute more than half of the importance of **all** features present in the data. This hints that we can attempt to *reduce the feature space* and simplify the information required for the model to learn. The code cell below will use the same optimized model you found earlier, and train it on the same training set *with only the top five important features*. "

However, it needs to be put into consideration that there's a significant drop in the f-score. A drop of close to 10% I don't believe is that significant and I would still be comfortable using the reduced dataset."
